## My motivaiton is to complete college without major debt. When I first started looking at colleges the prices in my opinion were crazy. Plus I always wanted to get my bachelors in computer science. But i first  started looing at loans and I found this bootcamp that can get me into the tech field in 6 months so it decided this might be my best course of action. My goal is to land a we;; paying job, or job that would be willing to pay for my college. I built this project because it was a great way to understand what code languages do and create. Before building this website I had no idea what css did and it caught me so off gaurd when it was the desighn of a website. A problem it solved was me not really knowing anything besides HTML and js. I truly learned alot, how to implimt code, how to use a terminal, how to orginize files and open on the terminal, plus alot more.
